Berkeley Parser Analyser -- Frequently Asked Questions

1. How can I make a bar figure like in the papers?

In LaTeX, define these two lengths:
\setlength\fboxsep{0mm}
\setlength\fboxrule{0.05mm}

Then write this for each box, (it makes a thick horizontal rule, inside a frame box):
\framebox[8mm][l]{\rule{1.3mm}{2mm}}

To make it easy to create a whole lot of boxes I defined some new commands:
\newcommand{\mybarheight}{2mm}
\newcommand{\myboxwidth}{8mm}
\newcommand{\mybar}[1]{\framebox[\myboxwidth][l]{\rule{#1mm}{\mybarheight}}}

And then wrote:
\mybar{1.30}

2. What do I need to do to see the colours in the output files?

If you are not seeing colours when you look at the output files (e.g. by
running "less <filename>") it may be because your terminal is not interpreting
raw ANSI escape codes (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Support).
For 'less' this can be changed by passing the '-R' flag (or '-r').
